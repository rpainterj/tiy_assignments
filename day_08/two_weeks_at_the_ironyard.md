## Two Weeks at the Iron Yard

In my last year of college, I got creative with the question of _"What are your plans after school?"_  
Depending on who was asking me, I would answer more or less vaguely, with any number of variables and qualifiers. Right now, some people undoubtedly believe I'm in Virginia, and some that I'm in Dallas. A few friends believe I'm selling paintings on the street, and others are certain that I'm looking for teaching jobs. I'm a graphic designer to some, an ad man to a few, and to a few acquaintances, I'm managing a fro-yo shop (it's a long story).

After two weeks of coding and web design, my title and industry is still nebulous. I'm using the catch-all term "web-designer," but it doesn't feel natural yet. I've never been a techie - or a designer, for that matter - and I'm wary of the effects of a tech-centered lifestyle. I'm barely testing the waters of the tech world.

Right now I'm ok with uncertainty, because I'm fascinated with the class. We've covered HTML, CSS, SCSS, GitHub, and we're just starting design. Every day, my mental framework is being reshaped. This course is just what I need to push through the confusion, work towards a goal, and expand what I believe it means to be creative. 

Who knows where it might take me? It's nice to be back in school.
