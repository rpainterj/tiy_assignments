### Paul
**Persona**  
Paul is thirty-two years old and a Spanish teacher at a public high school. He keeps a busy schedule tutoring students for extra money outside of school and writing in his spare time. He is very tech-saavy and likes trying new things. Paul needs a way to get his Level 1 students to practice their Spanish and do homework so they will pass his class. 

**Scenario:**
> Paul started teaching two years ago at a medium-sized public school with a small budget. The school board recently voted to cut French classes from the budget and Spanish is the only foreign language left. Paul and Sergio are the only two Spanish teachers. Each high school student must take at least one semester of Spanish, so each class Paul teaches has about 30 students. Last year, because of the class size, Paul had trouble grading all the students' written homework in a timely manner and several students fell behind on work, failing the class. After discussing teaching methods with Sergio, Paul discovers Duolingo. He finds the page and starts reading to see how it works.
