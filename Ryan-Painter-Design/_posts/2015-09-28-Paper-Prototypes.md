We covered prototyping in class today. There are many ways to prototype something you are going to build: sketching, static html, and wireframes are just a few of the many methods out there. 

Why use a prototype? Simply put, it helps you see how something will *actually* be used, rather than how you *think* it will be used. We can never predict the full range of human responses to a situation or device, so it's much easier to see them take place. You can set up a user test, study the user's thoughts and actions, and then adjust your design accordingly.

We got a chance to test out prototyping in class today. Our assignment was to improve a feature on an airline site by conducting a user test with a paper prototype. My partner Corey and I were assigned US Airways as our project. First, we went through the site as users, trying to complete tasks and discover pain points. This took us a while, because the US Airways site is actually fairly well designed. But we noticed a few confusing things about the layout of the flight booking page.

We sketched out some redesign possibilities then moved into a paper version of the site. Using simple sketches and post-it notes, we recreated a bare bones version of the flight selection process. When two of our classmates tested it, we let them input information and then supplied the appropriate sketches and post-its as needed. 

A few lessons we learned through this process:
1. Context is key. Users want to know where they are at all times. The flight selection process has so many steps that it is easy for a user to lose track of their spot on the site; this could in turn lead to confusion and wrongly entered information. 
2. Prototyping is not appropriate for every project. We came across some features, like button placement and labelling, that would be more efficient to improve using A/B testing or another research method. 
3. Protyping can lie. By nature, prototyping is a simplification. You can't recreate all the small, subtle visual cues and design structure that make a site work. What seems to be complicated on paper could actually become very intuitive at a higher level of fidelity to the finished product. We saw this in the overload of text that we had to provide on paper. On the site, a hierarchy of text and colors makes a section more readable and navigable than it appears on paper.
