Wrapping up week four at the Iron Yard in Austin, we spent two days learning about website accessibility. The first thing I think of when I think about accessibility is my friend from college, Matt Simpson. Matt was a senior when I was freshman, and someone I really looked up to. He has a great heart, a quick wit, and is very outgoing. He’s an outstanding athlete and currently works for the USA Olympic Museum. He is also blind.

I used to marvel at Matt’s skill with technology. He used some kind of screen reader, and would quickly skim a webpage on his phone while a voice rattled off words I could barely piece together. He could text, post on Facebook, and tweet just as easily and quickly as you or I. It’s amazing how far technology has come. But that doesn’t happen without a lot of behind the scenes work.

As we discussed ARIA states, screen reader technology, and designing for people with physical and attentional limitations, I got a small taste of how hard the internet can be for some people. I take it for granted that people use and understand the internet without much difficulty, but the reality is that design requires sacrifice. Someone’s wants and needs are always being sacrificed, whether it’s the elderly, the colorblind, the physically handicapped, or just “someone who’s not in the target market.” How do we justify design decisions to those people? Sorry, I didn’t have enough time to code that in? Sorry, but this page animation makes sense to internet-saavy people…and it looks so cool!? To me, the extra thought and code that goes into reaching that small percentage of overlooked people on the web is critical if we want the internet to really be a tool that helps others. Design with empathy. Design like a human.

Matt’s a super bright guy. Not everyone can adapt to technology so easily. My grandfather never used his computer because of his bad eyesight. How could I possibly begin explaining what a screen reader is and how to navigate a computer with it? In the rush to innovate, to design the next great interface, it’s worth considering the people who never had the privilege of using the old one.
