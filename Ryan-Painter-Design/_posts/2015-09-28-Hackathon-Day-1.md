One of the coolest things about the Austin Iron Yard is that it’s the only branch in the country that is running simultaneous UI-Design, Front End, and Back End immersive courses. That means I’m learning UI Design in the same building as people who are new to Front End and Back End. At lunch, during lab, and after hours, I’m often side by side with students from other classes. I’m picking up knowledge from them as they learn, and sharing what I know. It’s a really neat environment for collaboration and mirrors the way a real workplace would be set up. For the next four days, those relationships will be put to an extreme test.

Enter the Iron Yard Hackathon. Starting today, teams of students across classes have until Sunday night at 1 am to build a functioning, usable web app. I’m in a team with two front end devs and one back end guy. After some joint lectures and once a few parameters were established, each team pitched a project and began working.

My team is building an app that tracks donations to a charity. It serves as a dashboard for the owner of a charity to see how much each of their donors has given, how successful their campaigns have been, and see basic information on each donor.

Our goal is to deliver. Without a product at the deadline, a project is a failure. It might be sloppy, it might be simple, but it needs to work. So we are playing to each other’s strengths and limitations. With only 5 weeks (albeit long, long weeks) of experience, our back end dev Erik told us exactly what he could do, and we went from there.

I’m really looking forward to seeing how this project turns out. I know I’m going to learn a lot from working with developers for the first time. I just hope I’ll get a few hours of sleep.
