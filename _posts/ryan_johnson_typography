## Typography

One of Steve Krug's lessons from his book "Don't Make Me Think" has been on my mind lately.
People almost never use your website as you think they do. In fact, they spend a lot less time and effort on your site than you always think. Users skim content in seconds, gloss over anything complicated, and make quick, instinctual decisions.  

What does that have to do with typography? Well, all of your painstaking structure and decisions are being passed over in milliseconds.
Users are looking for information, and good type is there to aid that. When it comes to websites, there's no glory in typography. It's not about showing off, being perfect, or playing with innovative subtlety. The user is on a mission, and it is the job of type to get him or her there effortlessly.

Good website typography avoids being noticed, it just fits. Good typography moves the viewer through the page without distraction. Someone should be able to scroll rhythmically through your site on a phone or desktop and have a solid understanding of the content. Now, there may be a lot of skill and tinkering to balance form and readability, but at the end of the day, type has to be *easy*. A website should always be easy. Simple.
